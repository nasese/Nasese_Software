The Neurocognitive Assessment Software for Enrichment Sensory Environments (NASESE) is based on the JAVA 
and Processing programming languages and detects, displays and analyzes EEG signals for individual or a 
group of patients. This neuroinformatics software offers a digital painting environment and a real-time 
transformation of EEG signals into adjustable music volume and octave configuration per electrode, for 
the real-time observation and evaluation of therapeutic procedures. The EEG acquisition is wireless, 
therefore, brain data can also be collected from the application of other sensory or sensorimotor 
therapeutic sessions as well. NASESE includes two main functionalities, organized in five different modules.
The first functionality includes recording, filtering and visualization of the EEG signals exported to a 
rotating 3D brain model and a real-time transformation of brain activity to sound sculptures, while 
the second functionality generates statistical tests and coherence calculation in a fully customizable 
computerized
environment.
